Welcome to Python for Data Science!
We are delighted to welcome you into the first course of the EdX / UC San Diego MicroMasters in Data Science: Python for Data Science.  
In this course, you will learn both the basics of conducting data science and how to perform data analysis in python.

Course Outline
The course is broken into 10 weeks.  The beginning of the course is heavily focused on learning the basic tools of data science, 
but we firmly believe that you learn the most about data science by doing data science.  So the latter half of the course is a combination 
of working on large projects and introductions to advanced data analysis techniques.

Week 1 - Introduction:  Welcome and overview of the course.  Introduction to the data science process and the value of learning data science.
Week 2 - Background:  In this optional week, we provide a brief background in python or unix to get you up and running.  If you are already 
familiar with python and/or unix, feel free to skip this content.
Week 3 - Jupyter and Numpy:  Jupyter notebooks are one of the most commonly used tools in data science as they allow you to combine your 
research notes with the code for the analysis.  After getting started in Jupyter, we'll learn how to use numpy for data analysis.  
numpy offers many useful functions for processing data as well as data structures which are time and space efficient.
Week 4 - Pandas:  Pandas, built on top of numpy,  adds data frames which offer critical data analysis functionality and features.
Week 5 - Visualization:  When working with large datasets, you often need to visualize your data to gain a better understanding of it. 
Also, when you reach conclusions about the data, you'll often wish to use visualizations to present your results.
Week 6 - Mini Project:  With the tools of Jupyter notebooks, numpy, pandas, and Visualization, you're ready to do sophisticated analysis on your own.
You'll pick a dataset we've worked with already and perform an analysis for this first project.
Week 7 - Machine Learning:  To take your data analysis skills one step further, we'll introduce you to the basics of machine learning and how to use sci-kit learn 
- a powerful library for machine learning.
Week 8 - Working with Text and Databases:  You'll find yourself often working with text data or data from databases.  
This week will give you the skills to access that data.  For text data, we'll also give you a preview of how to analyze text data using ideas from the field of Natural 
Language Processing and how to apply those ideas using the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK) library.
Week 9 and 10 - Final Project:  These weeks let you showcase all your new skills in an end-to-end data analysis project.  You'll pick the dataset, 
do the data munging, ask the research questions, visualize the data, draw conclusions, and present your results. 
This course will introduce you to the field of data science and will prepare you for the next three courses in the MicroMasters: Statistics, Machine Learning, and Spark.


Overview
First, and foremost, you'll learn how to conduct data science by learning how to analyze data.  That includes knowing how to import data, explore it, analyze it, learn from it,
visualize it, and ultimately generate easily shareable reports. 
We'll also introduce you to two powerful areas of data analysis: machine learning and natural language processing.
To conduct data analysis, you'll learn a collection of powerful, open-source, tools including:

Python
Jupyter notebooks
pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Sci-kit Learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
And many other tools!
And you won't be learning these tools in isolation.  You will learn these tools all within the context of solving compelling data science problems.

Learning Objectives
Basic process of data science
Python & Jupyter notebooks
An applied understanding of how to manipulate and analyze uncurated datasets
Basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods
How to effectively visualize results
By the end of the course, you should be able to find a dataset, formulate a research question, use the tools and techniques of this course to explore the answer 
to that question, and share your findings.

What do you need to know to succeed?
This course is intended for learners who have a basic knowledge of programming in any language (Java, C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, Javascript, PHP, Python, etc.).  
You could have learned these basic programming skills on your own or taken a course in programming in high school or college.  

Your knowledge need not be extensive, but we'll assume you already know how to:

Create and assign variables
Write programs with loops
Write programs with conditions
Author and use functions (methods)
If you are unfamiliar with Python, we have an entire week (Week 2) dedicated to getting you up to speed with basic programming in Python.  
If you find that Week 2 progresses too quickly and you need more help with basic programming, you may wish to try an introductory programming course in Python 
before starting this course on Python for Data Science.
