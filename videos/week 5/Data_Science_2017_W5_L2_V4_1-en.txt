- We're working with matplotlib again in this video.
Continuing to explore that World Bank data set
that we started with.
So, by the end of this video,
you should be able to create
line charts and scatterplots using matplotlib.
So, a question I had about the data,
will allow us to explore using line plots
and scatter plots.
We saw that CO2 emissions per cap in the U.S.,
went up in the 1960's
and then with some minor variance
has remained pretty steady since.
I'm curious how that relates to the U.S. economy.
Specifically, the U.S.'s GDP per capita.
So, let's set up some more masks,
as in the last video,
to pull out the GDP per capita
for the U.S.A., over time.
And then what we'll do,
is we'll check with this output is
by running
the head method.
Looks like we have the data we want.
Per year, we have
the GDP per capita,
based in the value of U.S. dollars in 2005.
So, this is pretty similar to what we had
for CO2 emissions, per capita.
Alright,
before we plot these against each other,
let's first look at the trend
in GDP per capita for the U.S.
I'll use a line plot for that.
For the most part,
we're seeing solid growth, over time.
There are a couple dips here and there
and one, noticeable dip
in the recession around 2008.
But the upper trend, is restored by 2010.
So, knowing that CO2 emissions
over that same time period
didn't behave the same way,
leads me to think that they aren't closely related.
But, let's look at a scatter plot to see.
So first,
wanna make sure the time frames
are the same
by calling min and max in these columns.
And the reason I wanna make sure these
are the same,
is that scatter plots require
the same number of years
in the data set.
Ugh.
So, they both start in the same year, 1960
but I have more data for GDP than I do for CO2.
So,
I need to have the same number of data points
for the scatter plot
and to do that I'm gonna trim off those extra ones.
To do this trimming,
I'll just ask for,
the years before 2012.
Then I'll check that our data has
the same number of values for both
the GDP and the CO2 emissions.
Ah.
Here we go.
We have 52 years of data for both.
To make a scatter plot,
we'll first call out
the fig and the axis like we did before
using
the
plot that's all plots.
Most the rest should be fairly recognizable
except for the calls and method scatter.
To create a scatter plot with these two arrays.
Alright?
Now when I run this,
what I get back is a pretty weak relationship.
It looks like when,
GDP and CO2 emissions were climbing in the 60's
they track together.
But after that there doesn't seem to be
much of a relationship at all.
We could also test this using correlation.
I'll use the correlation coefficient function
in num pi to get back the relationship
between these two arrays.
The main diagonal
is each against itself.
So we expect to see 1.0 there
or perfect correlation.
But on the other diagonal,
we see zero point,
seven
0.077.
That's a really weak correlation
between these two indicators.
So, we just got to start looking at these relationships
but if someone were to argue we need
more CO2 production, per capita
to boost our economy,
this initial data analysis
would not support that claim.
I have more ideas for what to do with this data set.
Could we look at the relationship
between CO2 emissions per capita
and GDP for other countries?
What about over all CO2 and GDP,
minus the whole per capita component?
This is an extremely rich data set
so I encourage you to continue to explore these,
on your own.
