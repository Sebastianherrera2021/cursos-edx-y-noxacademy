- This is a short video introduction to the notebook
with additional Matplotlib examples
that will be provided for this week.
So by the end of this video, you should be able to
use additional Jupyter notebook resources as examples.
In our additional notebook,
we provide code for a number of examples.
Still working with the rural development indicators
we pick random indicators and compare them
against each other using line plots and scatter plots.
And then after working with the rural development
indicators, we also provide an example
of how to create 3D plots like this, in Matplotlib.
We also provide an example using bubble plots.
Bubble plots can be really helpful when
you want to graph three dimensions easily.
You can have an x, and a y, and a size of each point.
In this example, we also use color code
to provide a fourth dimension.
So on this image we have: angle, distance from the center,
size of the bubble, and color all coded here.
Know that unlike some of our earlier figures,
you need to spend time interpreting and understanding
the data in a figure like this.
But it could be incredibly valuable for data exploration
and for conveying more complex relationships
when you're presenting your data.
In addition to histograms, I frequently use box plots
when I'm trying to understand distributions.
This example provides you with a template for boxplots
and for placing figures side-by-side in Matplotlib.
Boxplots tell you the median,
values within the interquartile range,
and elements above the third quartile, and below the first.
As well as the maximum and minimum values.
That's a lot of useful information all in one figure.
So please be sure to check out these additional notebooks,
as well as other examples online
when you're looking for ways to visualize your data
using Matplotlib in your upcoming project weeks.
