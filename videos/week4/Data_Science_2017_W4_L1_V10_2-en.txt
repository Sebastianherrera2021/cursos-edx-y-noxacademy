- Let's review the practical skills
we learned in this lesson
based on the movie database notebook.
First we talked about data ingestion,
in which we reviewed how to ingest data
in multiple formats and the basic read operations
related to these formats.
We also talked about Series and DataFrame
as the two basic fundamental data structures in Pandas.
Then we overview the functions to perform basic
statistical operations on Series and DataFrames.
These will describe for joined descriptive statistics
and individual functions for generating min,
max, and standard deviation values.
Mode of data,
as well as functions for correlation analysis,
they're also reviewed.
We went through data preparation
and exploration options in Pandas like isnull,
any, and dropna functions.
We also overview data visualization
and in there we saw examples of inline plots,
box plots, and histograms using Pandas's plot function.
We also saw how to adjust the access formatting
and other window properties.
We talked about slicing out rows
and filtering data frames,
as well as aggregating data using the groupby operation.
The executive examples for running
basic statistical functions on these groups.
We also talked about merging
or joining data from multiple data frames
using inner joins and other operations.
We talked about three main string operations
called split, contains, and extract.
Finally, we talked about how to work with time stamps.
In summary, in this lesson
we went through the typical operations in data science
to take advantage of the Pandas library.
The movies notebook as a representative example
to keep as a reference
as any data science study will have similar steps.
