- Another example notebook for this week
is called the Protein Data Bank Analysis.
The notebook was developed by David Dorner,
one of our top students in the UC San Diego
Master of Advanced Studies program
in data science and engineering.
Although this notebook is not in the same format
as your final project, nor does it have all the steps
as we outlined there, it contains a number of components
of an excellent final project.
Namely, this notebook provides a great example
of using structured scientific data through an API
and visualizing it.
PDB is a large repository of semi-curated,
crowdsourced protein structure data.
The notebook uses PDB's RESTful Web Service
to access the data available in PDB
and uses the Boquet library to visualize the data.
Although most of you are not biologists,
we hope that you'll explore the notebook
for possible ideas you might wanna use in your project.
