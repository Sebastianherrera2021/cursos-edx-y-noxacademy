- Here's the explanation for the quiz that you just took.
In the quiz you were asked
how many times i is less than 10 gets evaluated.
Students commonly get this wrong,
mainly because of the confusion about the term evaluated.
But let's see how this works.
i is initially zero
and the condition i is less than 10 is tested.
The result being true.
i increments to one, we test i is less than 10 again.
Getting true back.
The loop continues.
i keeps incrementing.
The condition continues to be evaluated true and so on.
Before the last iteration the loop executes,
i is nine and nine is still less than 10.
If you said that 10 is the answer,
you were likely answering the question,
how many times does the loop execute?
But that isn't what was asked.
We asked how many times the condition,
i less than 10 is evaluated.
For that answer
we have to evaluate the condition one final time.
When 10 less than 10 is evaluated to be false,
that's when the loop condition terminates.
We've asked this question for the two reasons.
The first is it helps new programmers
see the step by step execution of a while loop.
The second reason is for more advanced programmers,
who might put a statement which has side effects,
like a function call into a loop condition.
It's easy to forget about that last evaluation of false
and if there's a side effect of that test,
that could be problematic.
Either way we hope this example was useful for you.
