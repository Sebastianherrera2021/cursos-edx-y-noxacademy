- Let's quickly discuss the answer to that last quiz.
In this last quiz you had two functions.
The question was which of these returns the absolute value?
Only function one returns the absolute value.
There's a pretty common misconception.
Printing and returning a value are the same thing
in programming, and this simply isn't true.
Whoever calls function two won't get a value back from it
to work with, so function two isn't returning
the absolute value.
It's just printing it.
