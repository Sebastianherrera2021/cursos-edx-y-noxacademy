- Alright, we'll walk through this last quiz
in some detail here.
In this last quiz we asked what is printed
when we ran the code above.
The answer is six comma three.
Although the swap function properly swaps values
within the function, it doesn't change what X and Y
points to just like in our video on functions.
If this tripped you up, please go back to that video
on functions and pay attention to the memory model
in the last example.
If you make a similar memory model for this problem,
you'll see why X and Y are unchanged by the swap function.
