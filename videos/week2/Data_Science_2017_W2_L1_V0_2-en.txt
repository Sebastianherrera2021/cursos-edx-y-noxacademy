- Welcome to the second week
of our Python for Data Science course.
This week is focused on the basics of Python and Unix
and is completely optional for those of you
with a background in both.
The Python portion is designed for those of you
who have program experience in another language
and just need a quick tutorial to get up to speed
on writing programs in Python.
For those of you with a bit of experience in Python
but could value some extra help,
feel free to pick and choose which videos to watch
or just jump ahead to the optional programming assignment
at the end of the Python lessons.
For the Unix part we'll be introducing you
to some of the tools that you may wish to use in the course.
Again, if you're already familiar with Unix,
feel free to jump ahead.
You can always refer back to these resources later
if you get stuck.
